# AGE CALCULATOR


## The Age Calculator web application takes a user’s date of birth (DOB) and the current date as input. It then calculates the user’s age in years, months, and days. The structure is created using HTML, styled with CSS, and the functionality is added using JavaScript. Users input their DOB, click the “Calculate Age” button, and the calculated age is displayed on the page. The application handles invalid input dates and provides a user-friendly experience. Customize and enhance this basic example to suit your needs!
